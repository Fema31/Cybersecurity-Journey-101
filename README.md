## 🧠 About Me & My Mission

Hello world! I'm **Fatema (FAH-tee-mah)**, a curious and passionate beginner carving my path into the cybersecurity landscape. I've always been fascinated by how things work and how to protect them. This repo is my public commitment to learning, a knowledge base for my future self, and a way to connect with others on the same path.

**My Goal:** To build a strong foundational knowledge in cybersecurity principles, develop practical hands-on skills, and eventually contribute to making the digital world a safer place.

## 🌟 Inspiration: Giants Upon Whose Shoulders I Stand

My journey is fueled by the legacy of those who paved the way. I am particularly inspired by the brilliance and resilience of pioneering women in science.

### 🏛️ Fatima al-Fihri
> **"Knowledge is a trust. What we learn, we owe to the world.”**

**Fatima al-Fihri**, a 9th-century Muslim woman, is a foundational figure in the history of education. After inheriting her father's wealth, she channeled it into building a center of learning for her community. She founded the **University of al-Qarawiyyin** in Fez, Morocco, in **859 AD**—recognized by UNESCO and the Guinness World Records as the **oldest existing and continually operating educational institution in the world**. This university became a legendary beacon, attracting scholars from across the globe to study sciences, astronomy, languages, and law. It was pivotal in spreading knowledge, such as introducing Arabic numerals to the Western world. Her story is a powerful reminder that the core of science and cybersecurity is **sharing knowledge to uplift everyone**.

### ⚗️ Marie Curie
> **"I am among those who think that science has great beauty."**

**Marie Curie**, a physicist and chemist, was a force of nature whose work fundamentally changed the world. Despite facing immense challenges and working in a rudimentary lab, her relentless curiosity led to the discovery of **polonium and radium** and pioneered the study of **radioactivity**—a term she herself coined. She is the first person and only woman to win Nobel Prizes in **two different scientific fields** (Physics and Chemistry). Her work, which ultimately contributed to her death from radiation exposure, was driven by a profound love for discovery. She is rightly called the **'mother of modern physics'**. Her life teaches me that profound beauty and groundbreaking discovery lie in dedication and asking the right questions, no matter the obstacles.
